# Megaman Maverick

## The Story

"The year is 20XX. Megaman was created by Dr. Light to lead the world into peace and prosperity. But dreams seldom come true the way they were planned to. Division and hatred spread across Mega City. The robots, malcontent, protest for equal rights. Many humans run away from the robots in fear, and the authorities, fearing revolt, have decreed that all disobeying robots must be shut down immediately. Suddenly, outbursts of robots going mad spread like a virus across the city. The rioting robots brand themselves the Mavericks. They speak of a leader who will rise and lead them to 'prosperity and justice'. Megaman is called at once to thwart the dangerous robots and save the day. This is no light task set upon Megaman. These robots are his brothers and sisters. 'You're either with us or against us.' There are heroes and villains on both sides. Megaman must make the impossible choice. There is no right and wrong."

## The Project

A simple fan game. I'm only working on this in my spare time so I'm not able to give it the attention and detail that I would truly like to. The game is written using Java and the LibGDX framework.
