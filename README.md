# Megaman Omega

## The Story

"The year is 20XX. The age of innocence wanes as division and darkness grow in the heart of Mega City. Poverty, sickness, and corruption destroy faith in institutions, and those who seize the opportunities for power do so without mercy. The humans, in their fear and desperation, begin to think that the robots are at fault for all of this. 'The robots want us dead! They're trying to replace us out of existence!' Many robots, fearing for their lives, run away and turn against their human masters. The city is on the precipice of total chaos and collapse. 'Megaman, Megaman!' the authorities call. 'You must save us! We don't know what to do, only you can put an end to this division!' Megaman, with dire conflict in his heart, hopes to restore faith and friendship. But deep down, he knows he might have to make the impossible decision. Who to save, and who to antagonize..."

## The Project

A simple fan game. I'm only working on this in my spare time so I'm not able to give it the attention and detail that I would truly like to. The game is written using Java and the LibGDX framework.
