# The story opens:

"The year is 20XX. The age of innocence wanes as division and darkness grow in the heart of Mega City. Homeless, starvation, and joblessness spread through the once-shining city. Driven by greed and corruption, corporations begin supplanting human workers with the cheap labor of robots. Neither the poor humans nor the robot workers are happy with this, but by means of hateful and wily propaganda, humans and robots begin to resent each other. Rumours begin to spread of a coming uprising from the robots. Leaks from the underground speak of a certain 'Z', "the Maverick against oppression", who will soon rise up and lead the robot race to conquer humanity. The authorities in the human government, not knowing what else to do, call on Mega Man to find this 'Z' and put an end to these brewing tensions one way or another. Mega Man, not knowing what to do, and with dire conflict in his heart, goes to the heart of the underground of Mega City to resolve this division and anger any way he can..."
